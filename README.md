## Getting Started
`npm install` to install all dependencies

`npm start` to run the development server

`npm run build` to build app for production to the `build` folder

## Wishlist
- [ ] Actual login (CAS) and server-side saving of data
- [ ] Ability to start a new SOA (while keeping old ones)
- [ ] Ability to copy job functions from previous SOA to new one
- [x] Text entry fields should clear when you click into them (e.g., [Specific Example]).
- [ ] Selecting an existing behavioral indicator should bring up the selector to change it.
- [ ] Ability to change competency and behavioral indicator for an entry
- [x] Ability to have more than one instance of a competency within a job function/achievement/goal
- [ ] Make impact statement optional
- [x] Get rid of "Also, " at the start of subsequent statements.
- [ ] Guided mode that walks someone through copy-and-paste of job functions from PD and goals from previous year's EPAR would be helpful.
- [ ] Guided mode to assist with copy-and-paste of information from EPARLibs to actual (crappy) EPAR app
- [ ] Indicator of operational/mastery level for behavioral indicators
- [ ] Maybe a tabbed interface for switching between job functions/achievements/goals?
- [ ] Not quite sure how to implement this while keeping simplicity, but more flexibility in structuring individual statements, such as free text not constrained by MadLibs format
- [ ] Periodic email reminders (maybe individually configurable) to add items to your SOA throughout the year.
- [ ] Work with central HR to get an API into the actual EPAR application so that one can just click "Upload my SOA" to move data from EPARLibs into EPAR.
- [ ] A small, animated paperclip that makes helpful suggestions as you type . . . wait, no.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
